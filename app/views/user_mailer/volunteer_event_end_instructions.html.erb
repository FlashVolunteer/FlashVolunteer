	<p>If our calculations are correct, you volunteered at <%event_name%> on <%event_date%>. We want to make sure you get credit for your hard work!</p>

	<p>Take a minute to <%= link_to("enter your volunteer hours", confirmation_url(@resource, :confirmation_token => @resource.confirmation_token))%>. If it turns out you didn't participate in this project, that's OK -- you should still <%= link_to("update your events page", confirmation_url(@resource, :confirmation_token => @resource.confirmation_token))%>.</p>

	<p>Remember, Flash Volunteer makes it easy to track your volunteer time, whether you have school-mandated service, or your employer donates matching funds for volunteer hours. <%= link_to("Sign in", confirmation_url(@resource, :confirmation_token => @resource.confirmation_token)) %>.</p>
