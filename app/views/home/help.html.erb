			<h4>What is Flash Volunteer?</h4>
			<p>
				Flash Volunteer is a new web-based engagement portal for volunteer service in Seattle. It allows users to find volunteer opportunities, as well as create their own volunteer events to support causes in their own neighborhood. Flash Volunteer was built by volunteers for volunteers and we hope you will use it frequently.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="faq-how_does_site_work_" class="hide">
			<h4>How does the site work?</h4>
			<p>
				After you create an account, Flash Volunteer allows you to manage all of your volunteer opportunities in one place. You can search for events, sign up for the ones you are interested in, invite your friends to join your Flash Team and even create your own volunteer events to address needs that are important to you and your neighbors. We also offer receipts, so you can get credit for service hours if you need them for school or work.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="faq-how_to_find_events_" class="hide">
			<h4>How can I find events?</h4>
			<p>
				You can find events through the event search, browsing through neighborhoods, and looking at your recommended events.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="faq-costs_of_fv_" class="hide">
			<h4>Does it cost anything to use Flash Volunteer?</h4>
			<p>
				Nope! It's free for everyone. All you need to do is create an account and you are off and running.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="faq-how_to_sign_up_for_event_" class="hide">
			<h4>How do I sign-up for an event?</h4>
			<p>
				To get involved, just click the "I'm thinking about volunteering" button on the event page. This will get you started and allow you to either sign-up for the event or track it on your profile page.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="faq-where_fv_gets_events_" class="hide">
			<h4>Where does Flash Volunteer get its volunteer events?</h4>
			<p>
				The majority of the events in the system are posted directly to Flash Volunteer by local nonprofits and Seattle residents. We also share events from <a href="http://www.allforgood.org">All for Good</a> to provide a wider variety of opportunities for our users. If you are interested in signing up for an event from All for Good, we will provide a direct link to the original post (so you can let the event host know you are interested) and also keep track of it for you in your Flash Volunteer account.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="faq-how_to_create_events_" class="hide">
			<h4>So, I can really create my own volunteer event?</h4>
			<p>
				Yes, you can! Flash Volunteer was built to give citizens the tools they need to become more engaged with their fellow neighbors. Just <a href="/events">Create an event</a> and you are on your way!
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="faq-what_about_inappropriate_events_" class="hide">
			<h4>What if I see an event that I think is inappropriate?</h4>

		<div id="faq-what_about_flash_team_" class="hide">
			<h4>What's my Flash Team all about?</h4>
			<p>
				Your Flash Team is a way for you to stay connected to your neighbors, friends and fellow volunteers. Following an event, you can add the volunteers you just met to your Flash Team and stay connected between events. It's another way to help build community and strengthen ties between volunteers, neighbors and friends.
